## StealthCore

### Description

StealthCore this program is designed to **bypass checks** for cheats for Rust (Alkad), but it is possible that it will be for other games. \
It was created with the aim of improving my C# skills (since I'm new to this).

### Features

- Downloading programs (eac bypass, superiority) safely.
- Safe removal of these programs.
- Cleaning the PC from logs and Google Chrome(History, Recent tabs).

### Getting started

- Download the file from the releases and put it on your USB stick.
- Reinstall Windows to clean everything (this is very important).
- Download Alkad Rust
- Run the program as an administrator and enter the activation key "KP69Z-O2V6U-YU1SN-XLLRU-KAGPZ".
- Then you will have a folder with the .exe file open it and you will have the Eac Bypass program.
- Click on the blue button to select the game folder and select the folder where Rust is located, Rust will open for you.
- Then go to the folder that the program opened (Setup.exe) and copy the path to the folder.
- Go back to the eac bypass program and click on the pink button to select the dll for injection.
- Paste the path of the folder that you have already copied, select the file with the .dll extension.
#### Clearing
- To perform the cleaning, you just need to register in the program "clean". Setup.exe and everything will clear up for you, then the program will close, after which take out your USB flash drive from the computer and you will be able to check.
